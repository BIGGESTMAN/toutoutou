[E] Possessed by Phoenix (possessed_by_phoenix) : Whenever Mokou casts an ability, she deals magical damage around her based on a percentage of her missing health for 3 seconds. Enemies further away will take reduced damage. When cast on a hero, this effect triggers around them as well, stacking with the original.
Spell Immunity - Damage and cast are blocked by Spell Immunity. Linken's Sphere blocks on cast.
DevNotes - Can't target and doesn't damage mechanical units. No initial damage. The damage is determined by her current health at the time of each instance, meaning it changes if her health fluctuates. Casting an ability while the effect is active will reset the duration. Activates off ALL her abilities, including Hourai Doll. When cast on an enemy hero, they will take the maximum damage. The cast version is based on Mokou's health, not the target's.
