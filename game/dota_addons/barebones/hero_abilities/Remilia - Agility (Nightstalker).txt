[Q] Gungnir (gungnir) : Remilia summons her spear for up to 10 seconds, causing her attacks to penetrate enemies in a line. She can cast this ability again to launch the spear, reducing the armor of all enemies it passes through while dealing physical damage. The armor reduction and travel distance is based on the number of damaging hits by the spear, and it will always take 1 second to fly to maximum range.
Spell Immunity - Pierces Spell Immunity.
DevNotes - Works like cleave. The cooldown begins to count down after the spear is thrown or expires. If the pierce hits multiple enemies the armor reduction/range gains a same number of stacks. The armor reduction is applied to the throw damage.
