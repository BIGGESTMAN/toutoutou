DevNotes - The hailstorm doesn't follow the enemy. The eye is the area in the center around the targeted enemy, which is unaffected by the hailstorm. The slow lingers for 1 second. No initial damage.

[W] Perfect Freeze (perfect_freeze) : Encases a chilled enemy in ice, dealing magical damage over time and completely disabling them until they take a certain amount of damage. The ice shatters on reaching that threshold, immediately dealing the remaining damage. If the enemy is not chilled, the ice shatters instantly.

[E] Cold Divinity (cold_divinity) : Enemies that attack or stay near Cirno for too long are chilled, slowing their movement and attack speed. The chill lasts 4 seconds and stacks up to 5 times.
DevNotes - The stacks are not separate and are removed all at once when they expire.

Lore (lore) : Ice fairies must be handled with care, lest they freeze appendages found dear.

[R] Super Ice Kick (super_ice_kick) : Cirno bores into an enemy with a flying drill kick for 2.5 seconds, stunning them and dealing physical damage based on her attack damage every 0.5 seconds. On impact and every 0.5 seconds, Cirno releases icy shrapnel around her that deals magical damage and mini-roots the first enemy they hit. Cirno gains spell immunity on cast that lasts until the kick ends.
Scepter - Reduces mana cost to 100/150/150. The shards deal 45 damage, penetrate, and chill at the current level of Cold Divinity.
Spell Immunity - The kick pierces Spell Immunity, the shrapnel does not. Linken's Sphere blocks fully on impact.
DevNotes - The shrapnel is released in a circle around Cirno and doesn't hit the kick target. The kick deals initial damage. The stun does not linger.
